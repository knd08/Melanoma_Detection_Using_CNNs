## General Information
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.



## Conclusions
- Models successfully built & evaluated, please see jupyter notebook for details.



## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
